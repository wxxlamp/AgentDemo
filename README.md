Based on the Python and Java Agent practices, learn the rules, thoughts, and methods of agent building. For example:
1. Enable myself to understand the principle of Code Agents (Codex, Claude Code, Qcode...)
2. Improve my AI - assisted coding efficiency in the actual coding process.
3. Apply the agent - building methodology to real - world business scenarios to help the business reach its peak.
